## 1. Summary 
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Concept
The MoMu consists of 2 technical concepts:
a <strong>digital instrument</strong> that users can move to create music with, and a <strong>digital platform</strong> that allows others to collaborate and share with the music they have created.

<strong>Instruments</strong> 

The Instrument consists of Accelerometer sensors that transform the user’s movements into digital drum beats and custom synthesizer sounds. This instrument was designed to combine the creative freedom of playing an instrument and the interpretive movement of dance without the limitations of either.

<strong>Platform</strong> 

The MoMu Platform is a digital space where users can share and collaborate with other artists. Users upload their work and artwork to the digital social media platform, and others can view, enjoy and remix their work. This organic community flow allows for the users to seek out unique sounds and dance moves that can inspire and encourage more creative music and rhythm.
